This project predicts how well students will perform academically based on how much they sleep and how much they study. Using ordinal regression, it models grades as ordered categories (like Poor, Average, Excellent), which makes predictions more realistic and interpretable than standard regression.

The model takes students’ sleep hours and study habits as inputs and estimates the likelihood of achieving each performance level. This allows students, educators, or researchers to see how changes in sleep or study patterns could impact performance.

The project includes:

1)Cleaned and preprocessed data
2)Ordinal regression model using statsmodels
3)Prediction outputs with probabilities for each grade category
4)Simple evaluation metrics like accuracy and mean absolute error
5)Insights on the relationship between sleep, study, and academic success

This is a small, interpretable, and practical model that shows how lifestyle factors influence learning outcomes. Future improvements could include additional factors like stress, extracurricular activities, and a web dashboard for interactive predictions.
